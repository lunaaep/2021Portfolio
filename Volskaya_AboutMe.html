          <h4><strong>About Me</strong></h4>
          <p>My name is Palina Volskaya and I am a freshman at Dublin High School. I am currently enrolled in AP Computer Science Principles. My career goal is to have a stable job and enjoy what I do for a living. My plans to achieve this are to: to take advanced math in high school, map out future professions and career paths I would want to explore, and find a college that suits my needs. In high school and college, I will try my very best to acquire as much knowledge and experience as I can, shown through my class participation, assignment completion, a good grade in the class, and additional extracurriculars. I want to be able to earn money for my work, and keep my family in good living conditions. I want to be able to be independent and provide for myself.
          <br>
          <br>
          I value my work, meaning that I am perseverant. If an assignment needs to be done, or a topic needs to be studied, I will stay up and finish whatever I have to do. Another example is my work for my extracurricular activities, which I always rush to get done.I do not have much prior experience in this field, but I adapt and learn fast, which is a skill I value. A major accomplishment is joining the high school debate team. While the club does not directly relate to computer science, it develops the skills of presenting, public speaking, and critical thinking, which are all important for any job area. I have learned that I work really well both on my own and in a team, whether I am leading it or not, and that I will put in my best effort to get the job done. Unfortunately, I do not have job experience yet, but I am always looking for opportunities to learn and be more prepared for my future.
          <br>
          <br>
          In conclusion, I may little work experience, but I am eager to learn and expand my interests and abilities, and I will do everything I can to achieve the goals that I set for myself. Continue looking through my website to find more information about me, as well as ways to contact me if you have any questions! Thank you for your time.</p>
