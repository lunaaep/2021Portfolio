          <h4><strong>About Me</strong></h4>
          <p>Hello! My name is Palina Volskaya and I am a sophomore at Dublin High School. I am currently enrolled in Honors Principles of Engineering. My career goal is to have a stable, well paying job, and most importantly, to love what I do for a living. My plans to achieve my goal are: to take every opportunity I can in high school, map out future professions and career paths I would want to explore, and find a college that suits my needs. In high school and college, I will put in my best effort, which will be reflected in the amount of studying and good grades, as well as always making sure that I am taking in the information I am learning, not just memorizing it for a test or quiz. I will take these steps so that I do end up going to work at a job I hate every single day. I want to be able to earn reasonable money for my work, and ensure that my family is always living in good condition. I want to be able to be independent and provide for myself.
          <br>
          <br>
          A prominent trait of mine is that I am persistent. If an assignment needs to be done, or a topic needs to be studied, I work towards finishing whatever I need to do. For example, I never leave assignments past their due date, as well as putting in daily effort into my extracurriculars. This quality is important to help me achieve my goals. I do not have a lot of experience in the field of engineering, but I look for opportunities to change that. For example, I make sure to make the most out of my assignments and projects, and attend various talks from guest speakers in different engineering fields. I have participated in enjoyable projects that have expanded my knowledge on both compound machines as well as professional teamwork. Another trait of mine is that I am able to pick up things very quickly, from things such as languages (both world and computer), and different applications. I am currently learning Spanish as well as refreshing my memory on programming languages, and enjoying both. In my free time, I like to work on projects in applications such as Adobe After Effects or Premiere Pro, whether they are individual or collaborative efforts. These projects are then posted on a social media page to increase my reach.
          <br>
          <br>
          One of my notable accomplishments is joining the high school debate team. While the club does not relate to engineering, it develops the skill of presenting, public speaking, researching, and checking information, which are important skills for any job area. I have learned it is difficult for me to focus and motivate myself, but once I do, I work really well both on my own and in a team, and that I will put in my best efforts to get the job done.
          <br>
          <br>
          In conclusion, I am still deciding on which career path I am leaning towards, but I have the traits and work ethic to hopefully turn my goals into reality. I am eager to learn, and use what I have to achieve the goals that I set for myself.
